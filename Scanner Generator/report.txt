This project was implemented using the c++ programming language.  The program reads in user input from the command line, and passes these commands to to the QueryEngine.  The queryengine then query's the scanner for various outputs.  

Usage:
-------------
Make file:

To Clean: "make clean"
To Build: "make" or "make all"
To run the output binary: ./main

The user will then be prompted to input the name of the file they wish to parse.  

Assumptions:
-------------
- User will only input valid text documents
- File to be scanned is in the same directory as the binary file


Scanner Class:
--------------
The scanner class takes into it's constructor the string name of the file into an ifstream.  This ifstream is parsed and token matching is done using the longest matching rule.  
At the same time, the scanner also keeps track of quoted texts and adds all valid and associated strings to custom structs that were created to hold these token "entries."  
Entries are then stored in vectors of entry structs and queried and sorted at will.  This class also contains two custom comparitor functions used in various means of sorting.

QueryEngine Class:
--------------
This class supports all the functionality required of the query engine.  When a user makes a request from the main (main.cpp) file, a corrosponding function is invoked in the QueryEngine class which preforms required logic and queries the Scanner class as needed.  
This function also contains 4 different comparitor functions used for sorting.

Main Class (main.cpp):
------------
This program handles the command line interface and invokes the QueryEngine class



Test Cases:
------------
All of these test cases are also in the "test.txt" file

"Hello world"
"Hello Jason"
and then he said "hello
onto the world I love thee"
